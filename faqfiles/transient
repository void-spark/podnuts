~FT   Userlevel~RS  : Transient                               ~FTPODnuts Revision

We have been asked by many users.. 
   ~FMWhy is it not possible for transient level users to use certain commands?~RS

The answer is quite simple and can be broken up into 2 parts, as follows:

   #1.  We wanted to eliminate all points of abuse from new users.
   i.e. user 'blah' logs into here for fun only came here cause he thinks
   people who like dolphins are stupid and likes teasing them. User Blah
   logs on and sends .tell after .tell after .tell to the first person who
   welcomes him, harassing for the fun of it.  Along with that same idea...
   we also don't allow transients .shout, .write, .smail as all of those
   commands can be used to abuse others. We want ALL regular users that come
   here to KNOW that they can't be abused in that fashion by a new comer
   that just wants to annoy people.  Being able to .ignore someone is just
   not sufficient.

   #2. This is a dolphin pod.  In every sense, we have tried to organize
   user structure to mirror that of a real dolphin pod.
   example:  An adolescent male dolphin swims into a new pod.  That dolphin
   will have to swim into the pod at the LOWEST possible social rank to fit
   in and even stand a chance or becoming a member. He will not be welcome
   in several things that regular pod members enjoy.  Patience is one of the
   things he must exhibit if he is to see his ranking increase in the pod
   structure.  

So, look at transient as being not only a safety buffer, but a way that
EVERYONE can get to know you.. and conversely for YOU to have a chance to
get to know and become comfortable with your new potential family.
It's in no way punishment... or our way of saying we don't trust you.
It is a vital and established necessity for the survival of any dolphin pod.
