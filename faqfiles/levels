~FMPOD user levels:

The user level structure is similar to that of a real dolphin pod.  There
are many grey areas in the matter of promotion just as there are in real
pods.  Below is a description of the order of ranking and some
requirments/responsibilities required to attain and hold a new rank.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~BMTransient
This is the level that all new users enter the pod at.  Just like a real
dolphin pod, it takes time for new users to be accepted and trusted.  New
pod members (transients) seldom are able to do all of the things that
normal pod members are able to and this fact of life is reflected
perfectly on this talker.
~FG~BBTransient Promotion
These requirments are not set in stone, but they are a base by which to
look and work forward to.
        * Transient must have several days TOTAL login time.
          (it's not the ammount of time that is as important as what you
          do during your time on POD)
        * Promotion is given only upon mutual decision by upper level pod
          members.
        * Logging on and idling is not a way to earn a promotion.  If you
          don't talk, there's no way you can benefit the pod.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~BMPOD_Member
This is the standard level of established users on POD.  This level has a
full scope of basic talker/interaction commands and is not a position
which the administrators of POD will put any responsibility unto.
Compliance with POD rules and ENJOYING yourself; just like all normal
dolphins do. :)
~FG~BBPOD_Member Promotion
Active participation in the assistance of new users and interest in the
inner workings of the talker are both definitely to the advantage of a
POD_Member expressing interest in becoming a POD_Elder.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~BMPOD_Elder
This is the first of the upper ranking levels.  This level has the
responsibility of handling any on-line disputes between users, helping new
users become comfortable, and helping with the design or new rooms, new
commands, and notifying coders of any errors present.
~FG~BBPOD_Elder Promotion
This is a promotion that is decided by only the POD_Leaders (Dolfin &
Delphina).  Requirments available upon request.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~BMPOD_Shaman
This position is a 'pillar of truth'.  The dolphin that holds this
position is trusted fully to be un-biased and fair.  This position only
answers to one higher and because of the level of trust that POD has for
he POD_Shaman, conclusions are seldom questioned.  Respect whatever user
holds this position, they have earned it.  In the absence of a pod leader,
the shaman is to be treated as such.
~FG~BBPOD_Shaman Promotion
Only through sale of POD will a promotion be given.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~BMPOD_Leader
This is the ownership level.  This place would not be if it weren't for
those that hold this position.  Coding, promotions, and
development/upgrading of this talker is done by those that hold this
position.  These are your leaders, not to be feared, but rather to be
trusted and embraced for all their efforts on your behalf.
