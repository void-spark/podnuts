   About the Firewall                                   RNUTS Version 3.0.2
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Your asking about the firewall?

We have included as part of this RNUTS system a limited firewall.  This 
was derived from a hack incident that concluded in the creation of the 
following security system.   This is not a fancy or very extravagant 
security system though I will state that it does help.  Any form of 
security is better than non at all.

The login Checks:

	As we all know the login prompt is probably the most insecure point 
on a talker.  People can try for hours to gain other users passwords.  This 
is the simple online form of this firewall, below is the format of what is
displayed to the admin of the talker, as users enter information at the
login prompt during login. 

-- login  : <site> --

This is displayed when a user connects prior to the entering of any data,
as you can see we already have their site.

-- who    : <site> --

This is displayed when a user does a login prompt who, sometimes users will 
do this to see who is loged in.  This has been used to gain users
loginnames.

-- passwd : <username> : <site> --

This is displayed when they have succesfully entered a username.  Though
they have not entered a password as yet.

-- quit   : <site> --

And of course this is displayed when a user desides and gives up a login
attempt by typing "quit" at the login prompt.


The background checks:

	There are three levels of checks that are run and logged in the 
background.  These are simply, a password check, and level check, and for
some paranoid admin, a sitefilter.  The sitefilter is not intended for any
other purpose but to mask the login site of the admin.  This is designed to
limit the capability of people from being able to mess with them via 
harasment.

These three checks are done at two points in the login process.  The
Password check is done everytime a password is entered.  If those
passwords do not match the users password then an attempt is loged in the
log, in the form of:

<date> <time>: Failed passwd check: <username>   <site>

Please not that I do not log the actuall passwd attempt...because some
users tend to misstype their passwords, and I feel that it is a privacy
issue.

The other two checks are done on completion of login. Where both password
and  username have been succesfully entered.  These are the level check,
which is designed for the wiz and admin levels.  If a user has been
promoted past the user levels, and has not been entered into the
'users_levelfilter' then they will be auto-demoted to the highest (probably
should change that to lowest) user level, and the following is loged in the
filterlog:

<date> <time>: Failed level check : <username>   <site>
<date> <time>: Filter level check : <username>   <level>

The format of the 'users_levelfilter' is as follows:

<username>  <level defined name>

You may comment out lines in this file by putting a '# ' in front of any
line.  The "level defined name"s are those #define's in the rnut.h file.

The sitefilter is where a users site is then masked by the data inluded
from the file 'users_sitefilter'.  These sitefilters are loged, and apear
in the filterlog as follows:

<date> <time>: Filter level check : <username>   <site>

The sites listed are those sites that the user loged in from, even though
it will not apear in the .people or anywhere else on the talker.

The format of the 'users_sitefilter' is as follows:

<username>  <mask.site.edu>

You may comment out lines in this file by putting a '# ' in front of any
line.
