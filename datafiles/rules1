=============================== POD Rules ===============================

This is a set of guidelines of expected behaviour on POD.

 What you do on your own is private, but, should anything you do
 be abusive or annoying to other characters, then be prepared to bear
 the full brunt of the consequences. This may involve anything deemed
 suitable by the adphins or superusers including complete banishment 
 from POD. Please see http://pod.ncohafmuta.com/pod/prules.html for
 a more detailed definition of user expectations.

 Multiple characters are frowned upon, all you are doing is simply
 wasting disk space. Anyone who is found to have multiple accounts 
 risks having ALL their characters brutally removed.

 The actions of any adphin or superuser are beyond argument.

 By entering POD, you are explicitly accepting these guides. Having 
 read all this, please remember that the aim of POD is simply to 
 relax and enjoy.
