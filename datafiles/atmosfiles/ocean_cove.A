Several large waves roll into the cove.
Some birds fly overhead.
Palm trees sway in the soft tradewind.
Kelp sways gently in the ocean current.
A cloud shaped like a dolphin floats lazily overhead.
Sea lions hop around playfully on the beach.
The shadow of a large manta ray blankets the cove.
A school of halibut swims through the middle of the cove.
Gentle waves break upon the beach.
A group of migrating lobster walk quickly along the bottom.
Two narwhals spar in the distance.
Whalesong can be heard coming from someplace distant.
An otter floats past chewing happily on a crab claw.
Two guardian dolphins rostrum-ram a rogue shark back into shark_alley.
