You find yourself in limbo... between worlds.  At the far end of the
tunnel you can make out the faint vision of a gentle, calm, welcoming 
cove.  The current keeps you locked in place no matter how hard you try to
swim.  It would seem that something is required of you before you can complete
your journey to this place.  A soothing whalesong permeates the underwater
environment as it softly repeats: "type .accreq (your email) for residency"
