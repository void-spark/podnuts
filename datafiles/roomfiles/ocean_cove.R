You open your eyes to a blinding flash and you fall from the sky.  Your
descent is slowed by some unseen force that manifests itself as a faint
blue glow.  Upon determination of your intended habitat (water or land),
the force brings you to a gentle rest.  You have arrived to the ocean
cove.
~FT**The cove~RS is sheltered from the violent currents of the open ocean.
The temperature is just right and the water is crystal clear.  The average
depth is about 35' and the bottom is covered with many smooth stones.  A
small sign is posted underwater with the following quote on it:
"Never forget that only dead fish swim with the stream." Obviously a
delphinic attempt at humor.
~FT**The beach~RS is many miles long and is blanketed with pure black
obsidian sand that has been ground for many aeons by nature to fine
grains.  Several large canopy palm trees cast cool shadows over select
areas of the beach to give land animals a nice place to sit.
