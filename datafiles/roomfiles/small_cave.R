You pass through a small wall of kelp and enter a secret cave.  Soft light
filters through the thick stalks of kelp and gives everything inside of
the cave a smooth looking texture.  Above you is a hole in the rock that
appears to go all the way to the surface.. perhaps once a volcanic fissure
that now provides you with cool clean air to breathe if you surface within
the small pocket it provides.
