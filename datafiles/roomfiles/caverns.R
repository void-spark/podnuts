Swimming around, you take note of what looks to be an opening near the
bottom.  Swimming inside, You notice what seems to be a wide passage. Your
sonar tells you that you are surrounded on all flanks, by the many
reverberations you receive. The water seems to push and pull at you,
making this journey quite fun. Then your sonar tells you that up ahead, it
seems to open up! You suddenly notice you are in a fairly large, bowl
shaped crevice. You rise up to the surface, and notice you can breathe
here. It is quite dark, and seems to be a nice place to relax, and rest if
you would like. Curiosity takes over, and you notice that the crevice has
countless other smaller openings, which seem to extend to infinity. You
feel very tempted to just take everything off your mind, and just rest,
knowing that you will be safe here.
