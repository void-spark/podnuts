The ocean foor comes nearer as the surrounding area turns into shallows.
A large system of coral has grown a city stretching for miles here. In a
particular spot, the coral growth becomes so dense that it appears as an
impenetrable wall. An opening in the thick coral, just large enough to 
accomodate perhaps something the size of an Orca, beckons you towards it,
the sounds of signature whistles within quite alluring. Gathering
courage, you swim inside the dark tunnel, your sonar easily guiding you,
and after a few strokes of your flukes, you find yourself in a most
wonderous place. The tunnel opens up to a rather large, bowl-shaped
arena, made up of the coral. The sun or moon glimmering through the
surface reflects off of the multitude of bright colours created by the
coral, giving everything a beautiful, rainbow aura.
