You swim through a barrier that is warm and seems to wrap itself around
you.  You can taste the pheromones rich and heavy in the water as it is in
spring.  Your entire body feels as if you had just been born, so
sensitive is your skin, so in tune to every motion, and so sharp is every
sound to you.  Random scans pass through your mind, your vision clear and
undisturbed.  The detail provided by your sonar's ability to record such
vivid images only heightens your level of excitement.  As the dolphin in
your mind kicks his/her flukes, you can see slit lips part and come back
together in a sensual dance.  The current has set you adrift deep into
slit dreams...
