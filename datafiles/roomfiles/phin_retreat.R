Away in this quiet, private spot you feel the comfort of knowing that you
are truly private and hidden from the rest of the world.  Ambient light
seems to come from all directions being emitted from clear gems mounted in
the walls.  The water here is crystal clear and is neither hot nor cold
and by some magical means beyond your comprehension, you can breathe here
without having to surface.
