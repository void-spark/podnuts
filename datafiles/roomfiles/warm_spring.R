A warm spring wells up from the bottom of the sea floor, providing
natural relaxation for any sea creature that wishes to enjoy it.
There are also some mineral deposits here, staining the ocean floor
with a contrast of beautiful colors. Nearby there is a kelp forest
which can be seen swaying in the underwater current.
