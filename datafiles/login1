============================ Welcome to POD! =============================

 POD is here for one and all as a place to relax and chat. The aim of 
 POD is simply to provide a nice, secure environment in which you can 
 talk. Nice, because it has a multitude of features to make life easier, 
 and secure because we guarentee that anything you do in private cannot 
 be snooped or intercepted by anybody but the people you intended to 
 talk to.
 It is usual if you wish to use POD on a regular basis, you will need
 to get 'residency'. This means you can use some of the more advanced 
 features of POD, and that all your information will be saved between
 visits. To get residency, you will need to submit your e-mail address
 which will be stored with your account.  This is done by typing:
 .accreq [your e-mail address] 
 There will probably be a 'adphin' on who can accept your request at 
 that time. Once in POD, the best thing to do is type '.help' and 
 '.help list' so that you can see the sort of help that is available, 
 and then carry on from there.
(If you want to abort the user creation process at any time, type 'exit')
