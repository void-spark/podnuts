   * Class IV laser products
       Power output >500 milliwatts. These CAN and WILL cause eye damage.
       The Class IV range CAN and WILL cause materials to burn on contact
       as well as skin and clothing to burn. These laser systems MUST
       have:
       A key lockout switch to prevent unauthorized use Inter-locks to   
       prevent the system from being used with the protective covers off,
       emission indicators to show that the laser is in use, mechanical
       shutters to block the beam, and red DANGER labels and aperture  
       labels affixed to the laser.
       The reflected beam should be considered as dangerous as the
       primary beam. (Again, I have seen a 1,000 watt CO2 laser blast a
       hole through a piece of steel, so imagine what it would do to your
       eye !)
