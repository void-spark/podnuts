~FT+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

~FT   Synopsis~RS : POD Transient rank is the base user level.  Transients
              are either new to POD, or they don't swim by all that much..
              hence the name.  This user rank is a very necessary part of
              the structure of our pod as it gives established members a
              chance to get to know new ones.
              Transients are limited as to the number and type of commands
              they have. For explanation, we suggest reading: 
              .help transient

~FT+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   User has a total of 42 commands.
