   Note: The phin you are speaking does not need to be in the same room
   as you for it to work. Also note that the name can be shortened.
   
   This command allows a private chat channel to be formed between two 
   users.  The ping command alone will merely send a request to the entered
   username to open an ecco conversation.  See .ecco for the second part 
   of this command structure.

   Multiple ecco sessions cannot exist.  Most recent ping sent is the
   active ping.
