~FT   Usage~RS    : macro                                 (to list the macros)

   Description:

   ~FRWHAT ARE MACROS?

   Macros are shortcuts. They make things easier to type.

   There are two kinds: system macros (set up by the wizards, which 
   everyone uses), and personal macros (your own set, made & used 
   only by you).

   ~FRCOOL! SO, HOW DO I MAKE A MACRO ?

   You make up with a name for the macro, and what you want it to replace.
   When you type the macro name, it's as if you typed in the replacement text.

   Here's an example:

   ~FG(TO MAKE A MACRO)~RS              .macro .cool=.echo This is very cool!
   ~FG(TO RUN THE MACRO)~RS             .cool
   ~FG(WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN IT)~RS - This is very cool!

   For example, what if I want to make a shortcut for something like this:

   Pooh hugs <my friend> tight, and smiles happily?

   Answer: You do something like this:

   ~FG(TO DEFINE THE MACRO)~RS .macro .hug=.emote hugs $1 tight, and smiles.
   ~FG(TO RUN IT)~RS           .hug Tiger
   ~FG(WHAT HAPPENS)~RS        Pooh hugs Tiger tight, and smiles.

   Notice the $1 in the first line? It's a special symbol, called a 
   *parameter*.  It means "replace me with the first word you type after 
   the macro name, when you run it". In our example, we typed .hug Tiger, 
   and so the parameter $1 got replaced by the word "Tiger".

   Guess what $2 replaces? Yup! The *second* word! You can replace up to 
   nine words like that.

   Here's another example:
       
   ~FG(TO DEFINE THE MACRO)~RS .macro .greet=.emote waves to $1, and says "$*"
   ~FG(TO RUN IT)~RS           .greet Jen Hi there!
   ~FG(WHAT HAPPENS)~RS        Pooh waves to Jen, and says "Hi there!"

   Notice the $*? It's another kind of parameter. It means "replace me 
   with all the words you haven't used yet." In our example, the first 
   word, "Jen" replaces $1, and the rest of the words are "left over", 
   so they replace $*. You can replace any number of "left over"
   words with a $*, after all the number-type parameters are used up.

   ~FRGOOD STUFF TO KNOW ABOUT MACROS

   Your macros are saved when you log out, so you only need to enter 
   them once.  Macros can contain multiple commands, separated by \\.

   Macros can also run other macros. "Hmm... tricky, you say! But what if 
   a macro runs itself, or a macro runs another macro which tries to run 
   the first again?   Won't it run forever then?

   No. A macro only gets expanded once. That way, you can put give the macro
   the same name as a command, or a system macro,  and run the command from
   within the macro. This can be useful for doing things like this:

   .macro .emote=.emote /~FR$*

   The above line makes all your emotes red. (See .help colour for info on 
   how colour codes work.) Note that your *name* isn't red, because the 
   emote command writes that, not the macro.

   ~FRHOW DO I CHANGE A MACRO?

   Just use the old name, and make a new macro.
   EXAMPLE: ~FG(THE OLD DEFINITION)~RS .macro .hug=; hugs $1
            ~FG(TO REDEFINE IT)~RS     .macro .hug=; hugs $*, and smiles.

   It's as easy as that!

   ~FRHOW DO I GET RID OF AN UNWANTED MACRO?

   Just redefine it as "nothing".

   EXAMPLE: ~FG(TO DELETE OUR ".hug" MACRO)~RS .macro .hug=

   Again, pretty easy.

   ~FRHOW DO I SEE WHAT MACROS I HAVE?

   Type .macro, all by itself.  You'll see a list of system macros 
   (you can't change these), and a list of personal macros (your 
   own personal set).  Your personal macros over-ride system macros,  
   so if you don't like what a system macro does, just make your own 
   macro that does what *you* want.

   ~FRI'M LOST!!!! :-( WHO DO I ASK FOR HELP?

   You can ask me, Dolfin, if I'm online, or sent me .smail if I'm not.
   (see .help smail or ask your local wizard for more info on sending 
   mail)  You can also ask any high ranking wizard, or anyone else you 
   think might know. If you're polite, people will generally be quite 
   helpful.   Or email me at "dolfin@tursiops.org"

   If you have any suggestions/comments/constructive criticisms, you 
   can send them to me, too. Feedback is *good*!

   Well, good luck with using the new macros, and remember to ask if you
   have questions!
