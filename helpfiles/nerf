~FT   Usage~RS    : nerf <username>

   This is a combat type game in which you start with 10 lives and a nerf 
   gun, that is empty usually.  The obbject is to nerf your opponent
   10 times before you have been nerfed 10 times.  Your nerf gun holds 5 
   shots but the accuracy of your gun depends only upon the speed in which
   you shoot.  The faster you shoot, the less accurate, and the more you 
   have to .charge your gun with 5 new shots.

   NOTE:  you must be in the designated nerfroom.
