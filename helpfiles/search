~FT   Usage~RS    : search <word list>

   This will search for the words in the word list in all of the 
   message boards that you could possibly see. Ie it wont show you 
   anything from boards that are in rooms fixed to private if you do 
   not have access to those rooms. The word search is done on an OR 
   basis, ie if any of the words are in a given message it will be 
   shown as opposed to all of the words having to be there.  This does
   not search the wiznote, admnote, or news boards.
