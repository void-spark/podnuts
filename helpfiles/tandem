~FT   Usage~RS    : tandem <user>
   
   Note: The phin you are trying to swim with must be in the same room
   as you for it to work.
   
   Tandem allows you to become the leader of up to 3 phins who will follow
   you from room to room in tandem formation.  Users who are following the 
   leader of the tandem swim cannot leave the room they are in on their
   own and must .break the tandem swim to regain individual control of 
   their room of choice.  This command is great for phins (up to 4) that 
   want to swim around with eachother.  Also works for members to tandem 
   swim transients to different rooms as well.
