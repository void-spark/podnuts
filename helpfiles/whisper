~FT   Usage~RS    : whisper <user> <message>

   Whispers a special something to someone in the room. Others in the room
   can see that you have whispered something, but they cannot tell what it
   is that has been said. It is a bit like an in-between between tell and
   sayto ( sto ). Messages are recorded in .revtell and the public version
   is recorded in .rev. You can only whisper to someone who is in the same
   room as you.
