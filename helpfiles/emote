~FT   Usage~RS    : emote <message>

   Emotes allow you to express emotions. A example would be 
   "Fred feels sad".  If you were logged in as Fred you would enter 
   ".emote feels sad" and your user name will be prepended to the 
   front. A semi-colon can be used as a short cut for this command so 
   ";feels sad" would have the same affect as the above. The result 
   is seen in the room you are currently in.
